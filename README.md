# Strong-Password

This is the strong password created      zT7&pW1!qL@3b^Sf*Xe$V9u#

First, I will create multiple passwords with varying complexity and then test them on a password strength checker tool.Here is a set of passwords created with varying complexity, length, and character types:

Simple lowercase only, short: "password"

Mixed case only, short: "PassWord"

Mixed case with numbers: "PassWord123"

Mixed case, numbers, symbols: "P@ssW0rd!"

Longer mixed case, numbers, symbols: "Str0ngP@ssw0rd2025!"

Very long with mixed characters: "Th!s1s@VeryL0ngAndStr0ngPassw0rd#2025"

Now, testing these passwords on a password strength checker from bitwarden.com and other sources:

"password": Very weak, common dictionary word, easily cracked.

"PassWord": Weak, predictable casing, no numbers or symbols.

"PassWord123": Moderate, better with numbers but common patterns.

"P@ssW0rd!": Stronger, symbols add complexity but still common substitutions.

"Str0ngP@ssw0rd2025!": Very strong, longer length, mix of character types.

"Th!s1s@VeryL0ngAndStr0ngPassw0rd#2025": Extremely strong, long and complex with varied characters.

Scores and feedback typically highlight length, unpredictability, and character variety as key factors for strength. Short passwords with common words score poorly while longer, varied character passwords score highly.

Next, I will summarize best practices and tips for creating strong passwords learned from these evaluations and research.Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords:

Prioritize length: Passwords should be at least 12–16 characters long to exponentially increase complexity against brute force attempts.

Use a mix of character types: Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols to maximize unpredictability.

Avoid common words and phrases: Simple dictionary words or predictable substitutions (like “3” for “E”) are vulnerable to dictionary and substitution attacks.

Avoid repeating patterns or sequences: Strings like "12345" or "qwerty" weaken password strength.

Use passphrases: Combine random words or a phrase with character substitutions for easier recall but strong complexity.

Use unique passwords for each account: Reuse increases vulnerability if one service is compromised.

Use password managers: Help generate and store strong randomized passwords rather than reused or easy-to-remember weak ones.

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): Supplements password security.

Summary of Common Password Attacks:

Brute force attack: Trying every possible combination systematically until the right one is found; longer passwords slow this down considerably.

Dictionary attack: Trying passwords from a list of common words and phrases, often with substitutions.

Password spraying: Trying common passwords across many accounts to avoid lockouts.

Credential stuffing: Using leaked username/password pairs on various services assuming reuse.

Rainbow table attack: Using precomputed hash tables to reverse password hashes.

Keylogger and social engineering attacks: Capture passwords by spying or tricking users.

Effect of Password Complexity on Security:

Increased complexity—achieved by longer lengths, mixed character types, and unpredictability—makes passwords exponentially harder to crack by any automated or manual attack method. Complexity increases the possible combinations an attacker must try, thus heightening security. However, complexity must be balanced with memorability as overly complicated passwords risk insecure storage or reuse. Multi-factor authentication can further bolster protection beyond password complexity alone.
